    * Reference any related issues.

## Adding a New Command

Titanio has a modular command structure, making it easy to add new commands. Here's a basic outline:

1.  Create a new file in the `src/commands/` directory (e.g., `src/commands/my_command.rs`).
2.  Implement your command's logic in the new file. This will likely involve using `teloxide` and potentially other crates (like `reqwest` for external API calls).
3.  Add a handler function, similar to the other commands.
4.  Import your new command module in `src/commands/mod.rs` and add it to the `match` statement in the `dispatch_command` function.
5.  Add your command to the `Command` enum in `src/main.rs`
6.  Update the `/help` command in `src/commands/help.rs` to include your new command.
7.  Document your command in the `README.md`.

## Documentation

* Keep the documentation up-to-date.
* If you add a new feature or command, update the `README.md` file.
* Clear and concise documentation is highly valued.

## Getting Help

If you have any questions or need help, feel free to:

* Open an issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/LoboGuardian/titanio-rust-telegram-bot/issues)
* Start a discussion.
