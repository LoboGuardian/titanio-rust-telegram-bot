## [0.2.0] - Future?

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This section includes sarcasm and dry humor for entertainment only.  
> It does **not** reflect any negative sentiment toward contributors, users, or features.  
> We respect and uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) ‚Äî this is just a friendly crab trying to keep things fun. ü¶Äüíô

### ‚ú® Added (Supposedly‚Ñ¢)

- A `/define` command because clearly no one knows what words mean anymore
- `/translate` ‚Äî because we *definitely* plan to go multilingual before we even finish English
- `/todo`, for the brave souls who think a bot can help them get their life together
- `/remind`, perfect for forgetting you ever set a reminder
- `/quote`, because who doesn‚Äôt need algorithmically sourced inspiration?
- Admin moderation tools so we can pretend someone is actually in charge
- Command cooldowns ‚Äî because spamming `/joke` 100 times *isn‚Äôt* peak comedy
- Unit & integration tests ‚Äî or as we call them, ‚Äúfaith boosters‚Äù
- GitHub Actions for CI, since pushing to `main` with no tests was starting to feel too powerful

### üõ† Changed (Allegedly)

- Made `/weather` less ugly. Now with more emoji and fewer regrets.
- Refactored API handling to avoid *yet another* copy-pasted fetch block
- Started i18n/L10n because someday this bot will be famous in at least three languages

### üêû Fixed (Maybe?)

- Now complains politely when you forget your Telegram token
- Switched to a public exchange API because who wants to log in just to check if the dollar is still sad

> Just for fun: If this changelog section offends you, we owe you a cookie and a sincere apology. We ‚ù§Ô∏è our community and this is all in good humor.
